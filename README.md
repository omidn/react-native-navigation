# Description
As selected icons on tabbed app does not support `selectedIcons` on Android(see [here](https://wix.github.io/react-native-navigation/#/screen-api?id=settabbuttonparams-)) and someone had already implemented this on android [here](https://github.com/farzadshafiee/react-native-navigation) I forked this repo from his/her work and rebased it with the master from the original repository. 

## Why didn't I create a PR?
As wix has announced, they're not going to maintain ver. *1.x.x* anymore and they are concentrated to release v2 ASAP.

## Why did I rebase?
There were some bugs that had been fixed on the original repo, but [this fork](https://github.com/farzadshafiee/react-native-navigation) was way behind them.
